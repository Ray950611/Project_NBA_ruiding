Although the project uses data scraping from basketball-reference.com, this folder presents some sample data files that are used 
in building the model and testing results.
The files 16team.csv and 17team.csv are team stats from the two seasons.
The files 2015-2016.csv and 2016-2017.csv are player advanced stats from the two seasons.
Other data used such as per game results data is not stored here.

The sample data are a small fraction of a potential larger data set to be analyzed. In particular, if the training dataset
is expanded to include more past seasonal results then the data size can be easily mutiplied by a factor of 10 to 20.
